/*
Static variables in a Function: 
When a variable is declared as static, space for it gets allocated for the lifetime of the program. 
Even if the function is called multiple times, space for the static variable is allocated only once 
and the value of variable in the previous call gets carried through the next function call.
*/
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;
  
void demo()
{ 
    // static variable
    static int count = 0;
    cout << count << " ";
      
    // value is updated and
    // will be carried to next
    // function calls
    count++;
}
  
int main()
{
    for( int i = 0; i < 5; i++ )    
        demo();
    return 0;
}

// Output: 0 1 2 3 4

// The variable `count` is not getting initialized for every time the function is called.
// As a side note: Java doesnâ€™t allow static local variables in functions.
